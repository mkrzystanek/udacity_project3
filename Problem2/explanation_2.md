rotated_array_search() function finds element in rotated array by
performing a two steps of binary search. Therefore, the time complexity
of the function in O(log n). 

The only impact on space during the life of the algorithm is made
by the input list. Space taken by every other variable created
during the execution is constant. Therefore the space complexity
of the function is O(n).
